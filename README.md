frozen

A MacVim colorscheme that's blue-ish.

I made this because I was and still am in a blue-ish mood at the time. Due to the game series Halo and the movie Frozen I had just finished watching. Not necessarily blue as in sad.

At the time I also thought other colorschemes were too bright. Even the "dark" ones used blinding white (#fff) font colors. Note that I work with low brightness settings, at least the lowest on my team. This is because I work in the dark, no really.

But to be fair that was one day. I've since receeded to a darker corner of the office.

I also thought most lively themes are trying to look too much like sublime's default theme. Which isn't for me.
